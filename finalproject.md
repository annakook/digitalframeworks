## Are immigrants threatening the American economy? 

By Anna Kook

In America’s recent heated debate over immigration, there’s divisive rhetoric both with reasoning on how immigrants are affecting the American economy. Immigrants have been characterized as antagonists who steal American jobs for a lower wage and in turn hurt the economy. 

As a part of this rising rhetoric, President Donald Trump was elected with promises to build a border wall with Mexico, get jobs back from China and to make it harder for immigrants to gain citizenship. 

At first glance, overarching trends seem to reaffirm the fact that immigrants are threatening Americans by taking jobs. Overall, there has been a steady increase of foreign workers entering the United States. Foreign-born workers are more likely than Americans to be employed in service occupations, which includes jobs in industries such as healthcare, food preparation, construction and personal care services.

The areas of work in which immigrants are most concentrated in are divided among low-skilled and high-skilled jobs. First, low-skilled workers earn less than an American worker would in the same field, according to the most recent data released by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. This raises the point that immigrants are more likely than an American to get low-skilled jobs because of competitive low wages.

But that notion depends on the fact that immigrants are identical to the low-skilled American counterpart, and thus immigrants are acting as substitutes. Wharton school of the University of Pennsylvania professor Exequiel Hernandaz says in most cases, they are not competing for the same jobs. 

“If there is any low-skilled worker that’s hurt by immigrants, it’s actually other low-skilled immigrants. So immigrants are substitutes for each other and not Americans because immigrants fill in different jobs than low-skilled Americans,” he said.  

On the other hand, a widely cited study conducted by Harvard professor George Borjas demonstrates that Cuban immigrants hurt Miami workers’ wages and jobs. Thus, Borjas draws a larger conclusion that low-skilled immigrants hurt America wages. Yet even if this were the case in certain communities, Hernandaz says this phenomenon is negligible compared to the total net effect. 

“Let’s say worst case scenario there is a negative effect, but that effect is very small on a very small population of uneducated Americans,” Hernandaz said. “But the issue is that most anger and political discourse is around that small population.” 

Besides low-skilled immigrant workers, there is a high concentration of foreigners employed in high-skilled professional jobs. Other than in the service industry, foreigners are more likely to be employed than Americans in occupations related to science, computer, mathematics and engineering.  

It is fair to say that these types of professional jobs usually require nuanced knowledge and high-level education. According to the data and chart below, it’s noteworthy that immigrants have a lower median salary than Americans at every education level besides a bachelor’s or higher.

One could argue that these foreigners are stealing high-paying jobs from Americans. Nonetheless, foreigners are actually filling jobs and providing skills different from an American, and those unique skills garner a higher wage.

“High-skilled immigrants actually have very strong positive effect and are creating more jobs and raising wages for Americans because they bring skills and ideas and fill in jobs that essentially are different from the skills American high-skilled workers have,” said Hernandaz.

These high-skilled workers with a bachelor’s or higher are working mostly under the Optional Practical Training program (OPT) and H1-B visas. The majority of these foreign graduates were approved for employment specialized in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, according to the Pew Research Center. Since last year, there has been a decline of the OPT program in part due to the Trump Administration’s tightened regulations that govern these visa programs.

While it is not clear exactly how many visas the USCIS grants to foreigners, it is true that the government has complete control choosing how many people in which industries are allowed to work in the United States.

But immigrants’ effect on jobs and wages is only part of the story. Research and examples have shown long-term benefits immigrants have on both capital investment and innovation. These elements in the end foster economic growth. 

Hazleton, Pennsylvania is an example. The population of Hispanics in Hazleton went from 5% in 2000 to about 45% in 2014. Initially, this influx of immigrants sparked anger as local residents feared immigrants would steal jobs. But after more than a decade, studies have shown the Hispanic immigrants have attracted more foreign direct investment and firms have offered more jobs to Hazleton residents. These companies are employing Mexicans but mostly Americans, and multiple Mexican factories have opened in Hazleton as a result.

“The general point is that research shows foreign companies are much more likely to invest capital and locate in places where immigrants in their home countries live and this applies to all sorts of nationalities,” Hernandaz said. 

There is no doubt that the American economy has benefited from immigrants especially with contributions to innovation. To site some of the extreme, the founders of some of the most successful technology companies in the United States are immigrants. Elon Musk of Tesla/SpaceX, Sergey Brin of Google, Jerry Yang of Yahoo and Pierre Omidyar of eBay are just some few examples. The tech industry has long demonstrated that when immigrants bring a unique set of ideas and skills, Americans provide complimentary skills to nurture lucrative products and firms.

Despite President Trump’s push to limit the number of immigrants flowing into the U.S., it is also up to the companies that make the hiring rules, as well as state government actors to look at evidence and accept more foreign workers as employees.
