## Assignment 7: Find a Story
I found that the Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democratic socialist candidate from the Bronx, NY received the most amount of donations from those in the state of Massachusetts and California after New York. And her donations are largely dominated by a non-profit organization called ActBlue.

To follow up on this story, I would observe what kind of candidates have been popular with those two states. It would also be interesting to look at what kind of states were contributing to her predecessor, Tom Manton, who is also a democrat. Something else I observed in the data that is interesting to look at is this organization named ActBlue donated a considerable amount of money but over extremely spread out and frequent occasions. For example, there was even a time when they donated just $1 multiple times. But also the largest amount of contributions came from the same organization. I’d love to learn more about ActBlue, a non-profit organization that builds technology, and their tactics in supporting Cortez. I’d also love to find out how ActBlue gets its money considering they’re a non-profit org. 

In order to find my story, I did: 
1.	Searched the FEC website for donations that “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez” received since she is considered such a novelty among candidates in the media right now
2.	Sorted through the data with states and compared the amount between states
3.	Also sorted through the amount donated by both ascending to descending and noticed both ends were dominated by ActBlue

Hed: Socialist Dem Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez gets most of her funding from a Massachusetts-based non-profit

Nut graf: The socialist democratic candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is a loud and proud New York resident from the Bronx but her biggest donator is a Massachusetts-based non-profit organization that focuses on technology. She has also been a vocal advocate of the people who seems adverse to the idea of receiving large sums of money from organizations. What is ActBlue and where are they getting their money from?
