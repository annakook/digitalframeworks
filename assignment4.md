#Assignment 4: Story Pitch

I plan to explore how immigrants are affecting the U.S. economy in different industries. With so much current political debate around immigration, and the notion that President Trump has put out that immigrants are stealing American jobs, the question I plan to answer is how are immigrants affecting the U.S. economy. In doing so, I want to observe what kind of industries that immigrants may be most dominant in, and how that industry impacts the U.S. economy. I think this will also try to answer the question for "are immigrants really stealing American jobs?" 

To do this, I will look at data that breaks down immigrants in the United States that are broken down by industry and different type of visas taken from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I would assume this data is pretty accurate considering that it is released by a government body. I will also look at how the data has changed over time and also get numbers on undocumented immigrants, and compare that to how much they take up of total immigrants in the U.S. 

To visualize the data, I think I'd divide graphs or charts into different sectors or type of visas that immigrants working in the U.S. have. I'd also try to visualize in a pie chart perhaps how much the industries that have most immigrants impact the economy. I think it will also be interesting to visualize with a scatter plot to show how saturated certain industries are with immigrants. 

In terms of sources to talk to, I want to speak to individuals whose experiences can speak to some of the more immigrant-dominant industires. Otherwise, I would also like an expert voice who has a good idea of the demographics of the U.S. and could provide explanations for the data.
