# Assignment 5 

The data I used is from the Bureau of Labor Statistics [here](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/forbrn.pdf)
1.	Of the immigrants working in the U.S., what is the education level for those who are the most likely to be employed? 

As expected, over the span of two years from 2016, it has been observed that those with a bachelor’s degree or higher occupy more than half of the foreign-born workers who are employed in the U.S. This probably means that those who are most well educated or have a highly marketable skills are the most likely to get a job in the U.S., and we can make the assumption that these are probably well paying jobs as well. This is also no surprise as there are many more visas such as the J-1 or H1-B visas that are allocated to foreigners/immigrants with high set of skills to work in the United States. 
2.	Given that most foreign-born workers working in the U.S. are highly educated, what kind of salaries are they receiving compared to Americans? 

It’s interesting because based on the data, foreigners who have a bachelor’s or higher, which is the highest number group of working foreigners, they earn on average more than $1000 a week and receive a considerate amount more than native-born Americans with the same education. Although this may be the case because there is a larger pool of Americans with the education level, I think it’s interesting that besides those with a bachelor’s or above, everyone else such as those with less than a high school diploma receive far less than an average American. 
3.	What kind of jobs are these immigrants/foreigners working? 

Based on the data, the occupation fields that foreigners are working mostly in are management and professional related occupations. Service occupations such as maintenance, cleaning, and personal care jobs come afterwards. The interesting thing from this data is that the field where foreigners are almost dominating in when compared to Americans is the natural resources, construction, and maintenance occupations whereas there are almost the double the amount of Americans in sales and office occupations. In real life, this means that some of the lowest paying service jobs are highly concentrated with immigrants. But the field that immigrants are in the most, also happen to be in the highest paying management and professional jobs.

To clean this data, I had to import everything into excel and organize them separately. Because the data was already separated into different sections and topics, I didn’t have to re-organize anything too much other than using the filter button to make some of the amounts/numbers go from largest to smallest. 

**Sample headline & nut graf** 

Immigrants most likely to be employed in either the lowest or the highest paying jobs 

According to data from 2016 to 2017 released by the Census Bureau of Labor Statistics, foreign born workers or immigrants employed in the U.S. are mostly working in either management and professional jobs or service jobs. And within these foreigners working in the U.S. those with a bachelor’s or higher have a great likelihood of working in the U.S. While these highly educated immigrants may be working highly paid jobs, data shows immigrants who don’t have such education are paid less than native Americans who have the same level of education.
